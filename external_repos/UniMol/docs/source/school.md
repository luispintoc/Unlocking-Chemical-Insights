# Uni-Mol School

Welcome to Uni-Mol School! This course is designed to provide comprehensive training on Uni-Mol, a powerful tool for molecular modeling and simulations.

## Course Introduction
The properties of drugs are determined by their three-dimensional structures, which are crucial for their efficacy and absorption. Drug design requires consideration of molecular diversity. Current Molecular Representation Learning (MRL) models mainly utilize one-dimensional or two-dimensional data, with limited capability to integrate 3D information.

Uni-Mol, developed by the DP Technology team, is the first general large-scale 3D MRL framework in the field of drug design, expanding the application scope and representation capabilities of MRL. This framework consists of two models trained on billions of molecular 3D conformations and millions of protein pocket data, respectively. It has shown excellent performance in various molecular property prediction tasks, especially in 3D-related tasks. Besides drug design, Uni-Mol can also predict the properties of materials, such as gas adsorption performance of MOF materials and optical properties of OLED molecules.
